Burnout in the workplace is becoming an increasingly common issue, affecting not just individual employees, but entire teams and 
organizations. When left unaddressed, it can lead to decreased productivity, poor mental health, higher turnover rates, and a drop 
in overall workplace morale. This report explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play a meaningful role in predicting and 
preventing burnout before it becomes a bigger problem. Using tools like machine learning, sentiment analysis, and behavioral 
tracking, AI can help organizations spot early signs of stress or disengagement by analyzing patterns in communication, work 
habits, and other indicators. This work also ties into broader global goals, particularly SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and SDG 
8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), by promoting healthier, more sustainable work environments.
